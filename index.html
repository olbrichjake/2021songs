<h1>Obi's top 50 songs of 2021</h1>
<p>A quick disclaimer is I'm writing most of the review parts in 2023. This year was a pretty down year in terms of overall quality looking in hindsight. The top part still feels really solid with some songs that revitalized genres while also pushing them forward into a new era.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">12.) Eidola - Forgotten Tongues</h2>
<p>Genre: Post-Hardcore</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/diHMg9aAInk?si=r3cqbsdmJyGkuN_S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I had a real hard time picking an Eidola track. This song over time has gained the most traction over time. The standout part of this song for me is some of best dynamic use of vocalists I've heard in years. Both Andrew Wells and Matt Dommer bounce off of each other. There are parts where they harmonize, parts were they echo each other, parts where they bounce off each other verse to verse. All of it works so well together. On top of some of the more underrated riffs on the album. There's minimal production that comes at the end of these quiet parts of the song that help build up/wind down to these prechorus/chorus section. Eidola has always written thought provoking lyrics revolving primarily around religion. This is no exception with a helpless search for some savior being at the expense of one's own health. The parallels of "I gave you all my blood/I gave you all my bones" only to follow each respective lyric with imagery of corrupted uses of what the character has sacrificed. Brilliant as always.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">11.) Free Throw - Cloud Sick</h2>
<p>Genre: Emo</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEpagu5rpj4?si=f23d8zpYfVjbrCsN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> One of the leaders of this new wave of emo that blends this midwest/math sound with a pop punk catchiness brings what is probably my favorite song from them. The intro riff by Jake Hughes is noodly but catchy enough to hum along to every note cleanly. Corey's guitar quickly kicks in to harmonize along with the rest of the band wher it sounds like a poppier intro than some of their contemporaries. The song and messaging still retains a grittier element (particularly from Corey's raspy delivery style). The contents in the lyrics are as onpar as ever with an honest look at the toll of being a touring musician and leaving your loved ones behind. Dealing with the anxieties and vulnerabilities referenced in other songs, the chorus does a good job of contrasting this with the titular subject of chasing one's dreams. "Say something, love/If you feel like you can't stay forever/I'm chasing dreams in the clouds, 'cause/I don't wanna feel like nothing forever/I wanna make you proud" forms its own pros and cons list: A loved ones feelings, your dreams, your worries, and tied with a relationship dynamic. The bridge towards the end of the song sees the band dial down for an intimate moment of coming back to a loved one sleeping and apologizing and promising the lost time will be made up. Overall, very touching and real song packaged up in some of the tightest pop-infused midwest emo this generation has to offer. </p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">10.) Don Broco - Uber</h2>
<p>Genre: Rock</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Dz7evHfvRw?si=7uDRvD_y8NbA_Oni" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Really fun that creates a really digestible aggressive sound. Usually these are the kinda tracks are more in the vein of "People" by The 1975 where is a half-assed attempt of a punk song by a non pop band. Not to say this is a punk song by any means, but Don Broco is talented enough and comes from a scene that cherishes aggressive styles enough to meld their own version into a relatable story. The guitars are chuggy while covered by some synthy electric noise. Each drum hit seems charged in some distortion as well. This isn't to say either feel inorganic either. For the entire three and a half minutes, Rob Damiani sings in a way that just sounds like someone would go off on an uber driver that's saying some insane shit. In the first verse he slowly builds up with "Been a long night, I've been out/I've been dealing with the driver/Who's sorry for my lot/'Cause my country got us/Mixing our blood'/And it's boiling his blood and that's boiling my blood/He won't shut the fuck up" " and then resets while the instruments strip back a bit and he restarts "Tell you I don't give a fuck if the world turns brown/Tell you I don't give a fuck, you pull over right now/Tell me how the fuck you not afraid to say that kind of shit/Tell me how you feel safe." This is just a 15 second clip of what the song is and it never really stays here because you got other parts where Matt Donnelly comes in with his silky clean parts. There's fade outs, breakdowns, and everything else you could possibly want in a song.</p> 

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">9.) Erra - Vanish Canvas </h2>
<p>metalcore</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Mr0Z8nIHg?si=mRKQ1KhtTQfksy5X" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Not gonna lie, before this song, I was about to tap out on Erra. The previous two releases never really grapped my attention and the previous singles felt a little more dynamic but still felt stuck in the box of what we knew Erra was. While I think this song is well inside that box, it's packaged and presented in a way where it becomes one of the most palatable metal songs ever. Jesse's guitars and vocals are so pristine and take the center stage for a majority of this song. In previous releases, it seemed like every chorus was just him belting words which carried a signature sound, but offered little more. This one features a variety of melodies in a quieter register that gives the song a distinct sound on the record. The complimentary lyrics "Anchors cast in the disarray/Drift away, drift away, unafraid of what awaits" and "Love you found in the empty space/Slipped away, slipped away in the fade" are personal highlights that feature, what I'd describe as, a voicecrack to the soaring vocal register he emphasizes on other songs. This song also features a version with Courtney Laplante which you think would elevate the song to an insane dimension, but I think Jesse does such an standout job that I prefer the original part. moving on, in the face of a million stringed guitars and heavy distortion, the picking sections of his riffs feel more harp-esque shit not a 7-string electric guitar with a billion pedals. There are definitely parts that fall in line with traditional metal guitars, and other guitarist (I believe by Sean Price at the time but could be wrong) creates a complimentary groove to the song which facilitates heavier parts for JT Cavey to impliment his midtone screams to their peak effectiveness.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">3.) The Plot In You - Letters To A Dead Friend</h2>
<p>Genre: Rock</p>

<p>Letters To A Dead Friend blends the raw emotions and honesty displayed on Happiness in Self Destruction with the sonic diversity in production elements displayed on DISPOSE. Combining the best of the last two releases into the intro track of this new album created an unrivaled amount of promise for what was to come (spoiler, I don't think any song hit the same high as this, but never hindered my excitement for this song). This song's production elements are top notch. Landon's voice cracks into screams intermentally throughout the song, but because of how well the song can compliment these, the song can remain quient and intimate and it works well. Sounds come and go as they need to with drum fills, strings, horns, and guitars never keeping the same sound as progression shifts. This is all smooth as the song builds up to a breakdown preluded by the quietest part of the song. This whole section features Landon whaling about how he should be dead and not the people he's writing letters to. The songs expresses a level of vulnerability that was last seen on display on one of my favorite metal releases ever in Happiness in Self-Destruction.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">4.) Gates - Where To Begin </h2>
<p>Genre: Post-Rock</p>

<p>One of the most underrated bands I've ever seen. They drop off the face of the earth in 2016, then drop this track on us 5 years later. In those 5 years, a lot happened. One tour and then busy schedules turned into a brief hiatus turned into cancer which turned into pandemic. Where do you go? From what I could read, the band's frontman, Kevin Dye, couldn't process the lyrics that he was writing. They were too dark or didn't speak in a way he wanted to express as a song. The pandemic and therapy helped him sort things out write the albume "Where To Begin" features on. The atmosphere featured in almost every Gates song feels moody, dark, and dreamy. The instruments are in line with the post rock idlings of Explosions in the Sky and This Will Destroy You and, on their own, would stand toe to toe with tracks from their discographies. However, the band features vocals and are allowed to escalate and descalate in a way to tell the story being written by a frontman. This is prominently featured in this track that is trying to figure out how to restart after everything in one's life is torn down. "I can make the walls crack/I can make the ceiling cave in/When I have to build it all back up/I don’t know where to begin," being the main chorus, is delivered in such a painful tone, you just want to forgive the band yourself and you don't even know the full context. Gates managed to find themselves in the same beat they left off on and I could not be happier for that.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">3.) Lorna Shore - To The Hellfire</h2>
<p>Genre: Deathcore</p>

<p>At the time of writing this, the song has 18 million views on youtube. The last deathcore/death metal track I can find to reach that number is "Reign of Darkness" by Thy Art is Murder which has hasd a full decade to reach the same number of views. It's an understatement to say that this song revitalized the deathcore scene. Beyond the obvious part that this song has one of the most insane endings of any song ever, a big reason I have this song rated highly is the band cranked up elements of syphomonic orchestra over blast beats and created a defining sound for the group. I don't think any of this is possible without Austin Archey whose legs must exist on a different plane of existence with how well he executes explosive kicks on every song. He cements a backbone for each thematic element to rest upon. And as you're transfixed on that, around the 4 minute mark, the song quiets down and then Adam De Micco shreds a riff and you're caught on that. Then in quiets down again and then the breakdown hits. The quartet that comprises the instruments would've made this breakdown alone of the best of all time, but what makes this song a fixture of deathcore and extreme metal for decades to come is how Will Ramos cemented himself as the premier vocalist in the scene. On top of all the gremlin screams and gutturals he does throughout the song, he takes it up to 11 and invents 20 new sounds to make all while this crushing breakdown is happening. Outside of me being a a cringe scene metalhead, this song should be heralded for everything it accomplishes in its runtime.</p>

<p>Landon Tewers is basically my favorite musician ever huh? From the intro to this song, I thought it was going to be my song of the year. My favorite pure rock song of the last decade easily. The intro strumming is so captivating. It contrasts a peppy sound with lyrics begging for death, a concept that's well-worn but is done here in such an infectious way, you never think about it. The chorus and each verse is packed with personality and delivered in complimentary structure to the guitars, creating the rhythm that's rotted my brain ever since. Adding Rory Rodriguez to this was the perfect feature. Rory sounds so perfect in every note he hits. Towards the end of his feature, he's met with group vocals that collide into a powerful punch of one last go of the chorus, the proper way to end such a catchy song. There's nothing here that's truly introspective or groundbreaking as a piece of sound or poetry, but checks off all the boxes of what a good song should be, a bopping three minutes I can listen to a million times and not get sick of it.</p>

<p>I'm not a historian in any scene, let alone the hardcore scene, but this record felt like it just created a new branch for the genre to grow. Many have already pointed out the evolution of Turnstile and referenced fellow Baltimore hardcore band (and vocalist Brandon Yates other project (though he's the drummer there)) Trapped under Ice, as carving out a nook in the melodic hardcore landscape and defining the sound. Looking at previous releases, you can tell what direction the sound was heading. At some point, the band should've hit a wall. If a hardcore band gets more melodic each release, they'll eventually become a pop punk band or something adjacent. I don't think this release or this album is that in any sense. Everything feels like it's written in the same cadence as a Sunami song, just with a different vibe. The obvious different would be the melody as they are described as a "melodic hardcore band" and I think everything in Mystery could be played a little harder and it becomes a run-of-the-mill hardcore song. But they don't do that, they diversify the sound. Paul Dika described the release as "genre-fluid" which I believe perfectly encapsulates this song. It plays like a hardcore song with post-hardcore, alt rock, dreampop, and shoegaze elements. All performed with an understanding of what makes those genres captivating to their audience. They let each member of the band get standout elements. There's a banger riff in the middle. There's a rhythmic bass fill. There's dreamscape production. At the end it sounds like you're getting abducted. It's such an insane song that provides a sound that carries the weight of it's forefathers but doesn't imitate them. It sets a new path in a punchy and fluid 150 second bop.</p>
